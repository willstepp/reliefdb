"Each time a person stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance" - Robert F. Kennedy

h6=. Believe it or not, you are already a user.  We don't require passwords to let you see info.  BUT if you want to add an organization to the database, or change something, or see confidential management contact info, then you will need to get a password.

Backstory:  This database was created to help communities "self-organize".  It was created after Katrina, but has lived on to help disasters of all types. Two years after Katrina, the group decided that poverty, and environmental destruction were disasters and so we kept on keeping on...

<p style="text-align:left;">Privacy Policy:  Unless the information is public already (like on your website, or listed in a public news space) or you tell us that it's OK to put it online in a public forum by putting it there yourself or asking us to, WE DO NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH ANYONE outside our small network of approved disaster workers!!! 

<p style="text-align:left;">Private Contact and Location Information Sharing Policy:  We have a password protected place in each "facility record" where you can store your cell phone, and private/personal location/contact info, and only those that you have given your password to (and a few core Citizen Action Team disaster relief operations people and a few very responsible FEMA/VOAD and other disaster relief pros that understand the importance of keeping your information private) can see your info.  This small group of people will not share your contact/private information without checking with you first.  It's only there for "internal purposes" only, so that we can contact you if there is a question about your listing, or if there's a disaster relief emergency.

<p style="text-align:left;">Email Policy:  The only bulk email we send out from "the database" is for database administrative purposes.  Historically, that's been less than once a quarter.  If we notice that you've registered a need for something that has come available, we may email you to let you know, or if you have something that is needed by someone else.  In the future, we plan to have an optional email notification of matches, where you will be able to "opt-in" for these types of mailings.  Currently, however, the only email you'll get from "the database" is your welcome email and an occasional administrative announcement.

"Fraud Reporting Policies":http://50.62.80.109:3000/shelters/show/1071 

<p style="text-align:left;">GO TO THE ABOVE LINKS and read the Indemnification/Disclaimer BEFORE USING THIS DATABASE. [summary: don't believe anything online.  People make errors and/or post things without knowing what's really true.  This listing service is no better than the newspaper, Craig's List, blogs, etc.  You must check for yourself.  DO NOT believe that just because groups are listed in this database that they are totally legit. YOU MUST DO YOUR OWN "VETTING" of the groups.  Most have websites which link to their 501(c)3 tax numbers and other reference information. Or you can call us for our "INFORMAL OPINIONS" if we have any.  Better yet, use your intuition! Call the group and get to know them!  

<p style="text-align:left;">The purpose of this site is not to be exclusive and create hurdles for relief groups to fall over...but to allow ALL groups to participate. For the nation to be able to utilize large numbers of volunteers in a crisis, we MUST be inclusive.  We MUST have faith that there will only be a very small number of cases of fraud.  To this date November 2007, of all of the hundreds of thousands of visitors and thousands of listings since September of 2005, we've only had two reports of fraud by groups posted on this site.  One turned out to be totally unfounded.  Information about the other one can be provided if you call us. Click the link above for more info about fraud reporting.
